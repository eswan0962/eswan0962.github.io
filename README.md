The air is moist and sweet and it feels as though I've never been here before. 
Everything feels familiar, but is so different. Simpler, directed. Even food is comprised of a few elements without much variation from day to day.

You’re either going to leave me now, or leave me in death. Either way it’s happening.

## blue gills and nunya

my feet are glossed with decay and excrement of that which grows

i keep my back toward the man-made gruff that turns and churns and plays with old fauna

in an attempt to see and touch something ancient

i behold something anew and more distant from me than i like to believe

murky mud metastasizes upon my shins as I sway with the low drawl of the water

stroking my little hairs and pushing against the inside of my thighs

currents and currents of life swirl about me

gangrenous, lake kelp getting caught in its own rhythm

as i kick my way through its home

gripping my ankles as to say, "You don't belong here."

letting me go as to say, "Come back soon."

everything outside of this membrane is bright and rigid and hard

everything inside is upturned and settled and upturned again 

soft

i stand...

neigh

relax upright in the water

looking down into the forest of blackened aqua, 

flecks of silver rain and sappy, bruised green play against my pupils

i open my eyes

hoping to see some conflict

i am the conflict, 

the fire that insights fear

and yet,

you swim up to me as to say, "I've seen you a thousand times before." 

welcome back.

never been so close and felt so comforted by curiosity

encircling me with inquisitive eyes,

glossing over my dull, fleshy skin

you must think me ugly 

in comparison to you

lithe, quick, and a symphony of 

gold and silver

sunlight refracting and reflecting off of you

and onto me

you're making me beautiful

feasting on and 

supping upon my flaky bits

much more tender than your scales

much less tender than your mind

i am the predator 

but i am  the one who is pierced
