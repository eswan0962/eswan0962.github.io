## If I was Huntan

The ultimate middle ground, the transitory state of being that allows you to go back and forth between the living and the idea of the end is becoming a reaper. Embodying a boatman who gives you coin to move on. By ferrying, you can ferry yourself. The balance of comfort and being a rigid fixture in the life of others. Prestige.

## Gutter Buddies

You have to be fanatic about everything and nothing. To be fanatic and empty and to get others to believe you, love you and want to move with you, you have to be active and accountable but allow for all outcomes. The failure of man however is then inability to see past structure and repetition... which is why nothingness is called to. Moment to moment variation is the actual rule and no creed beyond the responsibility of the body and laws of nature are dictitious (new word) to every interaction. Which federal laws are bendable enough to allow all advances lawful, and will the start of a new community need to begin with repression and then slowly ease out of it so it’s not immediately suppressed by larger regimes? If from the start there is fanatical repression, how does one make sure that the body moves away from that template to create the real order of chaos? Or is there even a need to start docile and then ease into truth and hostility?

## Note

there's a bittersweet and yet not quite bitter and not quite sweet notion that revolves around the end of me.

## Planes

My restriction is my perception that any other moment than this one exists. I stare out the plane and think... what if I died... what does that make me feel? I want to feel neutrally about it or even content... but I’m not. I’m dissatisfied because of what I believe I will miss. Something that doesn’t exists yet. An illusion where I am anticipating this wonderful thing that literally doesn’t exist, and neither does everything before it. My life before and my life after is neither here nor there... it’s not biological to be disappointed beyond the fact that I am no longer able to reproduce.. that is the singular reason to be at loss in this moment. When all I see is gray. Am I dead or dying or already at the space in between where the “you” that I am missing, as my plane goes down, doesn’t even know that you don’t exist either.

## Note

If it’s not this it’s something else. This is not a charity. We’ve all gone through something... everyone of us. And we are here to give you the extra of what we do have. Now I know you didn’t have the foolish idea that things are going to get better, because they aren’t. That’s not the lords way.

## What does the dark say?
You are not alone,

But because of this you must be (alone).

Nothing is equal,

And because of this you must choose.

Love can be boundless,

But because of this you must become

                    comfortable with solitude.
                    
You will never lose anything you hold close,

And because of this you will always hurt.

## Ohio
The air is moist and sweet and it feels as though I've never been here before. 
Everything feels familiar, but is so different. Simpler, directed. Even food is comprised of a few elements without much variation from day to day.

You’re either going to leave me now, or leave me in death. Either way it’s happening.

## blue gills and nunya

my feet are glossed with decay and excrement of that which grows

i keep my back toward the man-made gruff that turns and churns and plays with old fauna

in an attempt to see and touch something ancient

i behold something anew and more distant from me than i like to believe

murky mud metastasizes upon my shins as I sway with the low drawl of the water

stroking my little hairs and pushing against the inside of my thighs

currents and currents of life swirl about me

gangrenous, lake kelp getting caught in its own rhythm

as i kick my way through its home

gripping my ankles as to say, "You don't belong here."

letting me go as to say, "Come back soon."

everything outside of this membrane is bright and rigid and hard

everything inside is upturned and settled and upturned again 

soft

i stand...

neigh

relax upright in the water

looking down into the forest of blackened aqua, 

flecks of silver rain and sappy, bruised green play against my pupils

i open my eyes

hoping to see some conflict

i am the conflict, 

the fire that insights fear

and yet,

you swim up to me as to say, "I've seen you a thousand times before." 

welcome back.

never been so close and felt so comforted by curiosity

encircling me with inquisitive eyes,

glossing over my dull, fleshy skin

you must think me ugly 

in comparison to you

lithe, quick, and a symphony of 

gold and silver

sunlight refracting and reflecting off of you

and onto me

you're making me beautiful

feasting on and 

supping upon my flaky bits

much more tender than your scales

much less tender than your mind

i am the predator 

but i am  the one who is pierced
