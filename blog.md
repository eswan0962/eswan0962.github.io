## Waterways

there's a light cold upon my back, you sweet crested dandelion. taking me through willowy branches, like the spitting snap of a leaf in the wind. beaten upon my exfoliated young, and yet youngening face. the fog crawling up my tender neck. flicking up spindles of water upon my countanence. frosting upon my lips a nucleated measure of sustenance. i am here and supping upon the complex coronary of my anguish. crawling down my throat i pack the churned soil on top of my skin. covering my form from the world. moss. peat. slugs. they camouflage me.

## Grafts

By and by,

I chew my thumb.

Why oh why,

do I chew my thumb?

I sigh and sigh,

still I chew my thumb,

and little by little I die.

## Banal

How can I grasp at that lingering sound of the implication that pleasuring me is taxing. I am a job. Not your words, but all of the generalized actions. That I am a performance to be seized. I feel this tearing of my eyes, the ripe persimmon that is my heart, and the cementation of my loins. My passion instantly cremated at nobodies feet. When you ask me if it’s okay or that you feel pressure to cum for me.. to perform for me... resolved to me is the true nature of us. My turgid fingers that quaked beneath you, crinkling into myself. You hate see me hurting.. you love me... it is not a reflection of your horniness.. my bashfulness shrivels with each moment. I cannot brighten my eyes or sigh with honesty or gyrate without thought.. not when you reject me thus. And yet, I love you still. Enough to crumple next time and bloom your way tomorrow.

Do i do a good job as i sit down and sob.. Do i sob for me or do i shatter for you.. How can i see that tattered umbrellla, a old red flag sitting in your work shop next too your tool box. The box is next to a pile of gold you carry within yourself. You manifest it onto your floor and keep it clear of dust and grime. And yet it is still on the floor. Every so often a girl in white comes through and takes a coin and tucks it safely under her breast in a little zipper that holds her disposable heart. Too bad that it is all worth it for the candied acorns they bring you in the coldest breath of winter dawns. Damp and shivering you stare into the frothing flames licking the sky. You can keep watching forever as it falls away. Sighing deeply you gather yourself at our lap, tapering inward at the middle but the husks on your mouth are still sharper than any knife. Every second, i can't stand to see you falling, there's not a next time. Musical dadaisms play on your limber and lithe mouth as you bark into the earth and the smallest critters come in mass to your aria. A small caterpillar molts in the corner and larger larvae crystallize and labor on. Crusts on the ground penetrated with the tidal wave of worms continually eating and re-eating their own shit. Where can I hide from your heart's jealous pyre?

## If I was Huntan

The ultimate middle ground, the transitory state of being that allows you to go back and forth between the living and the idea of the end is becoming a reaper. Embodying a boatman who gives you coin to move on. By ferrying, you can ferry yourself. The balance of comfort and being a rigid fixture in the life of others. Prestige.

## Gutter Buddies

You have to be fanatic about everything and nothing. To be fanatic and empty and to get others to believe you, love you and want to move with you, you have to be active and accountable but allow for all outcomes. The failure of man however is then inability to see past structure and repetition... which is why nothingness is called to. Moment to moment variation is the actual rule and no creed beyond the responsibility of the body and laws of nature are dictitious (new word) to every interaction. Which federal laws are bendable enough to allow all advances lawful, and will the start of a new community need to begin with repression and then slowly ease out of it so it’s not immediately suppressed by larger regimes? If from the start there is fanatical repression, how does one make sure that the body moves away from that template to create the real order of chaos? Or is there even a need to start docile and then ease into truth and hostility?

## Note

there's a bittersweet and yet not quite bitter and not quite sweet notion that revolves around the end of me.

## Planes

My restriction is my perception that any other moment than this one exists. I stare out the plane and think... what if I died... what does that make me feel? I want to feel neutrally about it or even content... but I’m not. I’m dissatisfied because of what I believe I will miss. Something that doesn’t exists yet. An illusion where I am anticipating this wonderful thing that literally doesn’t exist, and neither does everything before it. My life before and my life after is neither here nor there... it’s not biological to be disappointed beyond the fact that I am no longer able to reproduce.. that is the singular reason to be at loss in this moment. When all I see is gray. Am I dead or dying or already at the space in between where the “you” that I am missing, as my plane goes down, doesn’t even know that you don’t exist either.

## Note

If it’s not this it’s something else. This is not a charity. We’ve all gone through something... everyone of us. And we are here to give you the extra of what we do have. Now I know you didn’t have the foolish idea that things are going to get better, because they aren’t. That’s not the lords way.

## What does the dark say?
You are not alone,

But because of this you must be (alone).

Nothing is equal,

And because of this you must choose.

Love can be boundless,

But because of this you must become

                    comfortable with solitude.
                    
You will never lose anything you hold close,

And because of this you will always hurt.

## Ohio
The air is moist and sweet and it feels as though I've never been here before. 
Everything feels familiar, but is so different. Simpler, directed. Even food is comprised of a few elements without much variation from day to day.

You’re either going to leave me now, or leave me in death. Either way it’s happening.

## blue gills and nunya

my feet are glossed with decay and excrement of that which grows

i keep my back toward the man-made gruff that turns and churns and plays with old fauna

in an attempt to see and touch something ancient

i behold something anew and more distant from me than i like to believe

murky mud metastasizes upon my shins as I sway with the low drawl of the water

stroking my little hairs and pushing against the inside of my thighs

currents and currents of life swirl about me

gangrenous, lake kelp getting caught in its own rhythm

as i kick my way through its home

gripping my ankles as to say, "You don't belong here."

letting me go as to say, "Come back soon."

everything outside of this membrane is bright and rigid and hard

everything inside is upturned and settled and upturned again 

soft

i stand...

neigh

relax upright in the water

looking down into the forest of blackened aqua, 

flecks of silver rain and sappy, bruised green play against my pupils

i open my eyes

hoping to see some conflict

i am the conflict, 

the fire that insights fear

and yet,

you swim up to me as to say, "I've seen you a thousand times before." 

welcome back.

never been so close and felt so comforted by curiosity

encircling me with inquisitive eyes,

glossing over my dull, fleshy skin

you must think me ugly 

in comparison to you

lithe, quick, and a symphony of 

gold and silver

sunlight refracting and reflecting off of you

and onto me

you're making me beautiful

feasting on and 

supping upon my flaky bits

much more tender than your scales

much less tender than your mind

i am the predator 

but i am  the one who is pierced
