## German Expressionists (late 19th and early 20th century)

basic motto : to produce art of the emotions, of frankness and intensity of feeling, and of the deeply personal and spiritual.

--> Expressionists were in general opposition of the romanticism of society and disgusted by realism and literal representation. They prefered to address and create art and drama that was born out of viseral, emotional responses to a specific experience and not focus on the "subject" of that experience themselves. In drama/theater this created an evolved stage that seemed like broken fractals of thoughts and bursts of juxaposed tones. As is the experiences within my/vous mind, flitting from one thought to the other unceremoniously. Often times expressionist, formally naturalist, and futuristically surrealist, art was/is dense, primal, exaggerated, simplified and unrefined. 

Before WWI German Expressionist wanted to revitalize the world of its stagnant academics and bourgeoisie expectations and make sense of the newly mechanised world. It is no surprise that after WWI the art would depict horrific stories of these artists experience. Apocolyptic energies and harems of political allegory would push forward additional political unrest throughout Europe and the world. 


## Where oh where did my (insert here) go?

When I don't find your eyes on mine in a fashion that speaks of longing and want, I feel no relief. Why? The chain of events must've been: 1) I seek no refuge in anyone. I do not need someone to confirm my worth or validate me. Born from a specific kind of independance via upbringing. 2) All of a sudden, I have a space where I can explore dependancy and trust and distribute unconditionality. In addition, I am around new people whom I do not have locationally cultural similarity and I am easily influenced by their idealogies and emotions. As we all are. 3) I fall in love with them and bare my ever-changing soul to them. Then the cages around that person/energy become rusty and are put away.. I either start reacting like the people around me or become their essence... or did I become more comfortable... or have I always been this way? I can't remember... I suppose prior understandings, no matter what they are, no longer exist. While experience is a good predictor, events are not actually a good representation of the here and now and later of micromoments.. macromoments, sure.

I believe it all to be whimsical, transient, loud and then gone. Do I prefer this to the whimsical, transient, quiet and then steady-state rigidity that is my understood default (at least formerly)?

## Self Flagellation

I feel it in my diaphram, in my lower back, in my lungs. I feel it in my hands as they continue to open and close and I lose awareness of the sensations of that actual movement. I clench my jaw tighter and let it quiver beneath the weight of the rest of my skull. I hurt and the extensions of me hurt too. This is ideal. To feel anything is to be alive. Yet, slowly the numbness closes in, telling me to windmill in every direction within the confines of my shell. A breath in. A breath out. A knife in. A knife out. A double edged sword. Commit to one path or the next and be resolved in it. Be and do exactly what you want. Confinement is good for no soul.. even if a soul exists, the more you control or doubt or plan, the more inevidible disappointment becomes. Like holding a dog on a leash, you and the dog are both burdened and enslaved. Let go of the leash. Hit yourself not with the metal clasp.

## Gratuitous Acts

Meeting you and you meeting me was always unforeseen. And this happens over and over. We happen over and over. How can it be that the same things that give me joy, that make me feel good, that lift me up... across time and space. 8822 miles. I continually gather my people and they turn into proverbial gold so quickly. Its disproportionate and unrare that I feel that love from another, yet it surprises me so. I will see you soon my friend, for we were meant to be vast trees of structure and Light.

## Nachos and Kosher Wine

Really strict rules and incredibly bland foods. Its cute to think about bringing things together and make them connect, but my favorite thing to see... the plot that really grinds my gears. Peppers my pot. Sprinkles my cupcake. Tickles my inflinitely wiggling pickles. Seeing two vastly opposing ideals or items or cultural phenomenon come together in an awkward and beautiful hodgepodge. A delicate surprise you never would have surmised that brought out the utmost delight in you. The stroke of their thighs. The blight in its eyes. Proving that its never too much to be everything at the exact birth of nothing. 

###### 11.14.2020
## What if that wasn't the case?

Let's invite new possibility. What if it is okay to feel love? Lets bring those two bits together so they close. At the time I would have a front face. A sock puppet that pops out for me. Integrate it. Tiny subtle movements that shows the twisting and creates awareness. Nimitta.

## Waterways

there's a light cold upon my back, you sweet crested dandelion. taking me through willowy branches, like the spitting snap of a leaf in the wind. beaten upon my exfoliated young, and yet youngening face. the fog crawling up my tender neck. flicking up spindles of water upon my countanence. frosting upon my lips a nucleated measure of sustenance. i am here and supping upon the complex coronary of my anguish. crawling down my throat i pack the churned soil on top of my skin. covering my form from the world. moss. peat. slugs. they camouflage me.

## Grafts

By and by,

I chew my thumb.

Why oh why,

do I chew my thumb?

I sigh and sigh,

still I chew my thumb,

and little by little I die.

## Banal

How can I grasp at that lingering sound of the implication that pleasuring me is taxing. I am a job. Not your words, but all of the generalized actions. That I am a performance to be seized. I feel this tearing of my eyes, the ripe persimmon that is my heart, and the cementation of my loins. My passion instantly cremated at nobodies feet. When you ask me if it’s okay or that you feel pressure to cum for me.. to perform for me... resolved to me is the true nature of us. My turgid fingers that quaked beneath you, crinkling into myself. You hate see me hurting.. you love me... it is not a reflection of your horniness.. my bashfulness shrivels with each moment. I cannot brighten my eyes or sigh with honesty or gyrate without thought.. not when you reject me thus. And yet, I love you still. Enough to crumple next time and bloom your way tomorrow.

## Calibral

Do i do a good job as i sit down and sob.. Do i sob for me or do i shatter for you.. How can i see that tattered umbrellla, a old red flag sitting in your work shop next too your tool box. The box is next to a pile of gold you carry within yourself. You manifest it onto your floor and keep it clear of dust and grime. And yet it is still on the floor. Every so often a girl in white comes through and takes a coin and tucks it safely under her breast in a little zipper that holds her disposable heart. Too bad that it is all worth it for the candied acorns they bring you in the coldest breath of winter dawns. Damp and shivering you stare into the frothing flames licking the sky. You can keep watching forever as it falls away. Sighing deeply you gather yourself at our lap, tapering inward at the middle but the husks on your mouth are still sharper than any knife. Every second, i can't stand to see you falling, there's not a next time. Musical dadaisms play on your limber and lithe mouth as you bark into the earth and the smallest critters come in mass to your aria. A small caterpillar molts in the corner and larger larvae crystallize and labor on. Crusts on the ground penetrated with the tidal wave of worms continually eating and re-eating their own shit. Where can I hide from your heart's jealous pyre?

## If I was Huntan

The ultimate middle ground, the transitory state of being that allows you to go back and forth between the living and the idea of the end is becoming a reaper. Embodying a boatman who gives you coin to move on. By ferrying, you can ferry yourself. The balance of comfort and being a rigid fixture in the life of others. Prestige.

###### 10.16.2020

Wild Bill helped me skin a coyote that New Light and I found in the desert. What and experience. I don’t think I can adequately describe it in words. So I guess I can just hope to remember it. I got blood all over the rental truck. A hunter shot the coyote and just left it for dead, and we just happened to find it. So I skinned the thing and threw its carcass in the desert. Brutal. Then we went to Grubstake down the road and I was still covered in coyote blood and smelled to high heaven. There were so many cowboys and country locals. The inquisitiveness about where we were from and our reason for being there were questioned, but then quickly we got invited to karaoke at the bar down the road. Old country music blared in the background with “Crazy Woman Ranch” swinging above the bathroom.

I ran home with the galaxy and the sagey air and the wind at my back. I felt at home. 


###### 10.15.2020

My nostrils sting and the rest of the skin around that peaked and exposed flesh is also on fire. I walked four full lines today, which is a major success in my book. The first two days were a series of mistakes and lost GPS Signal. For breakfast Bill and Carmila made French Toast and told us these amazing stories of them hunting and trapping beaver and Bill wrestling a beaver in the river. They seem like really hospitable people, though they are definitely set in their conservative and generations of western frontier traditionalism. They show no mercy to rule breaking and poorly behaved grandchildren. In Meemaw’s country, her rules are the only rules… no asking why, just do it. I think I really want to learn how to hunt and catch my own game. Seems more honest, as Danica said. I keep getting in bed by like 8:00 pm, my shoulders are dying. Just like all those antelope during the current hunting season. Ouch, my face. Again, the galaxy shines gayly above. 

###### 10.14.2020

Today, I thought about much ado about nothing. I walked back and forth and up and down the 1 km lines for magnetism. They think that there is gold in that there hill. I think I want to take up hunting. I wonder, tehe, if any of my partners would like to join me? I’m not really keen on learning from people though, at least not with intension. I would much rather just figure it out along the way. I’m sure that I learn a lot less because of this stubbornness. I am a sunburnt lobster with wobbly knees and a wobbly disposition. I like that I don’t get service out here. This is one of the rare occurrences where I have talked to myself and had really no body else to transfix on and interrogate. I’ve had songs weaving in my head. I’ve been dealt a boon pair of new balances from a generous woman named Miss Carmilla. She is the matriarch of this hotel and her and Wild Bills’ hospitality has no bounds. I’m envious of their set up. I guess I better start investigating land since there is now room for negotiation... This I am excited for… mountain towns might be on the top of my list now. I am more immediately excited to hold my beloveds and sniff their pits.

###### 10.13.2020

I think it is possible to be content in the middle of nowhere, assuming that there is a plan for survival. Nearly 8 miles of walking across brush and metamorphic batholith affected rock and coming across the bodies of recently and long passed creatures and creatures that have not extinguished from their earthly frame. I imagined, among other things, that we could build a house with this stone.. at first meager, but over time would become strong and resolved. Enough to withstand the Wind River. My face is raw and gnashed from the wilderness’ gusts which containing grains of sand, sage, and the like. I thought about trying to achieve minimal satisfaction and found that the easiest way seems to be boredom and absence of thought… or some form of distain for comfort, but it’s not like I don’t want to be comfortable. It’s that I don’t want to notice one way or the other. I just want to be. But then my toes started to hurt and as the miles passed on, I could only think of how far until the end of the line and until I can feel parched enough to be desperate for water. Desperation for water is one of my favorite things. The singularity of the need is transfixing. I want to thirst for other things in this way. Soon I was in that zone of singing a song to myself, as per usual, and in pain and… oh look, a snake skin… and a rabbit whom I paid no mind other than to watch it watching me… o’ hark, the machine is beeping incessantly.. I need water. How far away from the car am I? Am I that desperate? Yes. Sit down and more sand in my eyes. Blood in my shoes. Stank in my crotch. The swirling cyan colors of the sky and dusky brown and green and oranges of the ground rob me of care. I resigned to the comfort of the desert or at least the anticipation of its gifts. Will need different shoes though.

## Gutter Buddies

You have to be fanatic about everything and nothing. To be fanatic and empty and to get others to believe you, love you and want to move with you, you have to be active and accountable but allow for all outcomes. The failure of man however is then inability to see past structure and repetition... which is why nothingness is called to. Moment to moment variation is the actual rule and no creed beyond the responsibility of the body and laws of nature are dictitious (new word) to every interaction. Which federal laws are bendable enough to allow all advances lawful, and will the start of a new community need to begin with repression and then slowly ease out of it so it’s not immediately suppressed by larger regimes? If from the start there is fanatical repression, how does one make sure that the body moves away from that template to create the real order of chaos? Or is there even a need to start docile and then ease into truth and hostility?

## Tracing

C’mon baby, c’mon darlin, let me steal this moment with you now. Today has been an immense day of personal reflection into my willingness into fanaticism and what I believe I must do to become jewish and Japanese and “intense” to believe in “something” or “nothing” completely. To give in to those endorphins of the moment. To not simply observe one’s self it its distracted and selfishly placated state but to pour… pour into the moment you bite into that apple, the moment you smell them walk by and the world narrows into a fine boney straw, the shear thrill of the crackling of your teeth as someone’s hand collides with your face. I want that. I want to work on that. To do that I need to be silent to hear myself and not just the script I puke around my art piece. To do that I will need to wallow in my ego and hubris as well as set fire to my disgusts orbiting those traits. To do that I will need to swell into my paralysis when I feel intensely. To do that I must train myself to associate paralysis with severe discontentment and want it to change. And to do that I must push myself to the cliff of discomfort and pleasantries and cleverness and trick myself into committing compartmentalization suicide. Drain my swamp of shame, regret, analysis, control… and keep draining without recharge. Like our aquifer. The clams will die and so will “the before”, but I guess then I will have it all. Like I’ve always wanted.

## Note

there's a bittersweet and yet not quite bitter and not quite sweet notion that revolves around the end of me.

## Planes

My restriction is my perception that any other moment than this one exists. I stare out the plane and think... what if I died... what does that make me feel? I want to feel neutrally about it or even content... but I’m not. I’m dissatisfied because of what I believe I will miss. Something that doesn’t exists yet. An illusion where I am anticipating this wonderful thing that literally doesn’t exist, and neither does everything before it. My life before and my life after is neither here nor there... it’s not biological to be disappointed beyond the fact that I am no longer able to reproduce.. that is the singular reason to be at loss in this moment. When all I see is gray. Am I dead or dying or already at the space in between where the “you” that I am missing, as my plane goes down, doesn’t even know that you don’t exist either. 

###### 08.28.2020
## Note

If it’s not this it’s something else. This is not a charity. We’ve all gone through something... everyone of us. And we are here to give you the extra of what we do have. Now I know you didn’t have the foolish idea that things are going to get better, because they aren’t. That’s not the lords way.

## What does the dark say?
You are not alone,

But because of this you must be (alone).

Nothing is equal,

And because of this you must choose.

Love can be boundless,

But because of this you must become

                    comfortable with solitude.
                    
You will never lose anything you hold close,

And because of this you will always hurt.

The air is moist and sweet and it feels as though I've never been here before. 
Everything feels familiar, but is so different. Simpler, directed. Even food is comprised of a few elements without much variation from day to day.

## blue gills and nunya

my feet are glossed with decay and excrement of that which grows

i keep my back toward the man-made gruff that turns and churns and plays with old fauna

in an attempt to see and touch something ancient

i behold something anew and more distant from me than i like to believe

murky mud metastasizes upon my shins as I sway with the low drawl of the water

stroking my little hairs and pushing against the inside of my thighs

currents and currents of life swirl about me

gangrenous, lake kelp getting caught in its own rhythm

as i kick my way through its home

gripping my ankles as to say, "You don't belong here."

letting me go as to say, "Come back soon."

everything outside of this membrane is bright and rigid and hard

everything inside is upturned and settled and upturned again 

soft

i stand...

neigh

relax upright in the water

looking down into the forest of blackened aqua, 

flecks of silver rain and sappy, bruised green play against my pupils

i open my eyes

hoping to see some conflict

i am the conflict, 

the fire that insights fear

and yet,

you swim up to me as to say, "I've seen you a thousand times before." 

welcome back.

never been so close and felt so comforted by curiosity

encircling me with inquisitive eyes,

glossing over my dull, fleshy skin

you must think me ugly 

in comparison to you

lithe, quick, and a symphony of 

gold and silver

sunlight refracting and reflecting off of you

and onto me

you're making me beautiful

feasting on and 

supping upon my flaky bits

much more tender than your scales

much less tender than your mind

i am the predator 

but i am  the one who is pierced
